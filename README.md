**# Stock-Market-Analysis-using-LSTM**

**Introduction:**

Stock market analysis involves the examination and evaluation of the stock market to predict its future movements and to make informed investment decisions. Traditional approaches to stock market analysis include technical analysis, which examines historical market data to spot trends and patterns, and fundamental analysis, which examines economic and financial variables influencing the value of companies. However, more advanced methods like LSTM networks have gained popularity since the development of machine learning. Because LSTMs can identify temporal relationships and patterns that other algorithms might miss—a critical skill in the highly unpredictable world of the stock market—they are especially well-suited for this task. 

**Applications of LSTM in Stock Market Analysis**

Price Prediction: By studying historical price sequences, volume trends, and other relevant data, LSTMs can forecast future stock prices.  
Risk Assessment: Long Short-term memory models (LSTMs) can assist in evaluating the risk attached to various stocks by examining trends and volatility in past data.  
Portfolio management: By simulating different portfolio scenarios and allocating assets optimally to maximize returns and minimize risk, LSTMs can be used to optimize portfolio management. 

**Objective:** 

We'll find and examine stock market statistics, especially those related to certain technology stocks (Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft). In this project, we'll learn how to retrieve stock information from yfinance and utilize Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize various parts of it. We'll examine many methods for assessing a stock's risk based on its historical performance. We'll also be using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach to forecast future stock values. 
In this project, we will cover the following points: 
1.)	How much did the stock price fluctuate over time?  
2.)	What was the stock's average daily return?  
3.)	What was the different stocks' moving average?
4.)	How did various stocks correlate with one another?  
5.)	How much of our money is at danger when we buy a certain stock?
6.)	How can we try to forecast the behavior of stocks in the future? (Using LSTM to forecast Apple Inc.'s closing stock price)  


**Conclusion:**
This project effectively utilized data analysis and machine learning to provide valuable insights into stock market dynamics. The combination of correlation analysis, risk assessment, and predictive modeling with LSTM allows for a comprehensive understanding of market behaviors, aiding in better investment decisions. While the tools and methods used here provide significant insights, it's important to consider the inherent uncertainties and volatilities in the stock market, which can impact the accuracy and reliability of predictions.
